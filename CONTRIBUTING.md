## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before submitting a bug report, please check that it has not already been reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/owner/project/issues).

> **Note:** If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue on our repository and use the provided bug report template as a guide.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](https://github.com/owner/project/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue on the repository and provide the necessary details:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to illustrate the steps**.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to StateForward? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` issues:

* [Good first issue](https://github.com/owner/project/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain StateForward's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible StateForward
- Enable a sustainable system for StateForward's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides).
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
* When only changing documentation, include `[docs]` in the commit title.

### Python Styleguide

All Python code must adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the Python style guide.

### Documentation Styleguide
