"""

Module for preprocessing tasks utilizing the Visitor pattern.

This module defines a `Preprocessor` class that inherits from the `Visitor` class provided by the 
`stateforward.model.visitor` module. The `Preprocessor` class, which serves as a base class, is designed to 
be extended with specific preprocessing behaviors to be applied during traversal of certain data structures or 
graph nodes.

Attributes:
    __all__ (list of str): A list containing the names of all classes and functions exported by this module, 
                          which at the moment includes only the 'Preprocessor' class.

Classes:
    Preprocessor: A class derived from `Visitor` that serves as a template for creating specific 
                  preprocessors. It looks for methods with the prefix 'preprocess' to apply during a visitation.
                  This class does not implement any preprocessing methods itself and should be subclassed to 
                  add concrete preprocessing logic.

    A class that extends the functionality of a 'Visitor' class for the purpose of preprocessing.
        This 'Preprocessor' class serves as a base class that can be used to create specific preprocessors by providing a 'visit_method_prefix'. It inherits from a 'Visitor' class, indicating that it likely follows the Visitor design pattern, which allows new operations to be defined without changing the elements on which it operates.
        Attributes:
            visit_method_prefix (str): A string that defines the prefix used for visit methods. This prefix is used to dynamically determine the method to call during the visit process.
        Note:
            The specific implementation details, such as methods and their behaviors, are not provided in this docstring. Implementers should provide additional documentation on how the 'preprocess' methods are defined and used within this class structure.
        Inherits:
            Visitor: The parent class from which 'Preprocessor' derives the visitation functionality.
