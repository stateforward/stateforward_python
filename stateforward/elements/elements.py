    Enumeration for defining the concurrency kind of behaviors in a state machine.

    This enumeration specifies how behaviors and events are managed within a state machine

    Attributes:
        threading (str): Indicates that behaviors are executed sequentially. When a behavior
            is triggered by an event, it will run to completion before the next behavior begins.
        threading (str): Specifies that each behavior runs in its own thread, allowing for
            true parallel execution of behaviors.
        multiprocessing (str): Behaviors are executed in a separate process, suitable
            for CPU-bound operations that require full utilization of CPU cores.
        asynchronous (str): Behaviors are managed asynchronously, and their execution can
            overlap in time, without necessarily running in parallel at the OS level.
            This option is ideal for I/O-bound operations.

class Behavior(model.Model):  # , Generic[T]):
    """
    Represents the behavior associated with states in a state machine.

    A behavior is an action or series of actions that may occur when a specific event is
    processed by the state machine. This class is designed to be subclassed to provide
    custom behavior logic as needed for different states.

    ClassVar Attributes:
        concurrency_kind (ClassVar[ConcurrencyKind]): Specifies the kind of concurrency used
                                                       by the behavior. Options include
                                                       threading, thread, multiprocessing,
                                                       and asynchronous.

    Attributes:
        activity (Callable[['Behavior', 'Event'], Union[Any, asyncio.Task]]):
            A callable representing the activity to be performed. When behavior is executed,
            this function is called with the behavior instance and the event as arguments.
        context (Union[T, 'Behavior']):
            The context in which the behavior is executed. This is typically the state or the
            state machine that the behavior belongs to.
        pool (Collection[Event]):
            A collection of events that are considered part of the behavior's event pool,
            which it may respond to.

    Note:
        The `activity` attribute can be either a synchronous or an asynchronous callable,
        depending on the concurrency kind specified.


    !!! info
        The actual concurrency behavior is determined by the model Interpreter, and the `concurrency_kind`
        simply provides an indication of how the behavior is meant to be executed in terms of concurrency.

    !!! example "Example"
        === "light_switch.py"
            ```python
            # ... existing code from the LightSwitch example

            # Defining a new Behavior by inheriting the Behavior element
            class PrintBehavior(sf.Behavior):

                class On(sf.State):
                    entry = sf.bind(PrintBehavior)  # Binding the PrintBehavior to the entry event
                    exit = sf.bind(PrintBehavior)   # Binding the PrintBehavior to the exit event

                class Off(sf.State):
                    entry = sf.bind(PrintBehavior)  # Similarly for the Off state
                    exit = sf.bind(PrintBehavior)

            # ... continuation of the LightSwitch example
            ```
        === "Output"
            The example output below illustrates the invocation of the `PrintBehavior` for each state's entry and exit procedures, with accompanying event details.

            ```bash
            LightSwitch.region.region_0.Off.entry<4313140624> -> None
            LightSwitch.region.region_0.Off.exit<4313140752> -> LightSwitch.region.region_0.transition_from_Off_to_On.events.OnEvent
            LightSwitch.region.region_0.On.entry<4313137296> -> LightSwitch.region.region_0.transition_from_Off_to_On.events.OnEvent
            LightSwitch.region.region_0.On.exit<4313139536> -> LightSwitch.region.region_0.transition_from_On_to_Off.events.OffEvent
            LightSwitch.region.region_0.Off.entry<4313140624> -> LightSwitch.region.region_0.transition_from_On_to_Off.events.OffEvent
            LightSwitch.region.region_0.Off.exit<4313140752> -> None
            ```

            This output demonstrates that the behavior is correctly associated with each state, with the `bind` function ensuring that each behavior is instantiated as a unique object. In contrast, without the `bind` method, multiple states could end up sharing a reference to the same `Behavior` instance, as behavior definitions are types. Using `bind`, we can also pass arguments to adjust the behavior's attributes, allowing for tailored functionality within each state.
