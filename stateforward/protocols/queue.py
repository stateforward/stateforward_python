"""

The `queue` module provides a `Queue` class as a protocol with type variable `T`, which represents the generic type of items that the queue can contain. The `Queue` class defines several methods to interact with the queue in a thread-safe manner, making it suitable for concurrent programming.

- `task_done()`: This method indicates that a formerly enqueued task is complete. It is typically used by queue consumers after an item has been processed.

- `join()`: This method blocks until all items in the queue have been processed. It is used to wait for all queued tasks to be completed.

- `qsize()`: Returns the approximate size of the queue. It may not be accurate in multithreaded contexts due to the nature of queue operations.

- `empty()`: Returns `True` if the queue is empty, otherwise `False`. This is a snapshot of the state of the queue and may not be reliable in multithreaded environments.

- `full()`: Determines if the queue is full. Similar to `empty()`, it's a snapshot and may not be accurate in the presence of multiple threads.

- `put(item, block, timeout)`: Adds an item to the queue. If `block` is `True` (the default), the method blocks until a free slot is available if the queue is full, or until an optional `timeout` is reached. If `block` is `False`, the item is put on the queue if a free slot is immediately available, otherwise, the method raises a `Full` exception.

- `get(block, timeout)`: Removes and returns an item from the queue. If `block` is `True` (the default), the method blocks until an item is available, or until an optional `timeout` is reached. If `block` is `False`, the method returns an item if one is immediately available, or raises an `Empty` exception otherwise.

- `put_nowait(item)`: Equivalent to `put` with `block` set to `False`. It enqueues an item without blocking.

- `get_nowait()`: Equivalent to `get` with `block` set to `False`. It attempts to immediately remove and return an item from the queue without blocking.

This module is designed to facilitate communication between producer and consumer threads without the need for explicit locking. It abstracts away the complexities of thread synchronization while providing a clear protocol for queuing and dequeueing items.

    A protocol that defines the expected methods and behaviors of a queue data structure.
    The Queue protocol specifies interface contracts for queue operations. Any queue implementation
    conforming to this protocol must provide these methods.
    
    Methods:
        task_done():
             Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete.
            Used by queue consumers to signal the task is finished. The semantics of task completion
            depend on the concrete implementation of the queue.
        join():
             Block until all items in the queue have been received and processed.
            This method is used to wait for the completion of all the tasks in the queue.
        qsize():
             Return the approximate size of the queue.
            Note that the size is approximate because there may be pending add or get
            operations that are not yet reflected in the size.
        empty():
             Check if the queue is empty.
            Returns True if the queue is empty, False otherwise.
        full():
             Check if the queue is full.
            Returns True if the queue is full, False otherwise.
        put(item:
