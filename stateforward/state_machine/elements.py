"""

Module `elements` defines classes and interfaces for creating and managing state machines with asynchronous capabilities.

This module provides the `AsyncStateMachine` class which serves as a composite state machine implementation, integrating functionalities from `elements.StateMachine` as well as `elements.CompositeState`. It is designed to work with the `StateMachinePreprocessor` and `StateMachineValidator` for preprocessing and validation of the state machine configurations. Additionally, it utilizes the `AsyncStateMachineInterpreter` for interpreting and running the state machine in an asynchronous manner.

Classes:
    AsyncStateMachine: A composite asynchronous state machine class inheriting from `elements.StateMachine` and `elements.CompositeState`. It utilizes custom preprocessor, validator, and interpreter components for handling state machine logic.

This module is part of the `stateforward` package and depends on the correct functionality of subordinate components such as preprocessors, validators, and interpreters specifically designed for asynchronous operation within state machines.

It is assumed that users of this module have prior understanding of asynchronous programming paradigms and state machine concepts, as the module deals with advanced systems design requiring such knowledge.

    A class that represents an asynchronous state machine, inheriting from StateMachine and CompositeState, and utilizing a custom state machine preprocessor and validator as well as an asynchronous interpreter.
    This class serves as a framework for creating and managing state machine logic asynchronously. The state machine preprocessor is used to preprocess the input data before it's sent to the state machine, and the validator ensures the state machine's configurations and transitions are valid. The interpreter executes the state machine's logic in an asynchronous context, allowing for non-blocking operations and potentially handling concurrent state transitions.
    Attributes:
        preprocessor (StateMachinePreprocessor): An instance of a preprocessor class used to prepare data for the state machine.
        validator (StateMachineValidator): An instance of a validator class used to verify the correctness of the state machine's structure and transitions.
        interpreter (AsyncStateMachineInterpreter): An instance of an interpreter class that handles the asynchronous execution of the state machine.
    Note:
        The class is implemented as a Python 'pass' entity, indicating that it serves as a placeholder and should be subclassed or expanded with additional functionality in practice.
        The actual implementation details of the methods and properties inherited from 'elements.StateMachine' and 'elements.CompositeState' are not provided here and should be referred to in their respective class documentation.
