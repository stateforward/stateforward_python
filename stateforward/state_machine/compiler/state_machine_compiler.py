Module `state_machine_compiler` Overview

This module contains the `StateMachineCompiler` class which is responsible for compiling `StateMachine` objects. The main functionality of this module is encapsulated within the `compile` class method of the `StateMachineCompiler`.

The `StateMachineCompiler` class serves as a utility to process and translate `StateMachine` instances into a target representation or code. The target output is not specified here and can vary based on the implementation details which are not included within the scope of this documentation.

The `compile` class method is the primary interface provided by the `StateMachineCompiler`. It takes an instance of `StateMachine` as an input parameter and performs the compilation process. Currently, the method is a placeholder and needs to be implemented to fulfill the objective of the compiler class.

This module is expected to grow as the compiler functionalities are expanded and might include additional classes or methods to handle various aspects of the state machine compilation process.

Note that the actual compilation logic and the definition of the `StateMachine` class are outside the scope of this module overview and should be referred in their respective modules or documentation.

class StateMachineCompiler:
    """
    A compiler for converting a StateMachine object into an executable representation.
    The StateMachineCompiler is designed to operate on StateMachine objects, turning them into a form that can be executed by a suitable machine or framework. The compiler class utilizes class methods, implying that the compilation process does not rely on instance-specific data and should be consistent across different instances.
    
    Attributes:
    
    Methods:
        compile(cls, state_machine:
             StateMachine):
            Transforms the provided StateMachine object into its executable counterpart.
            The method takes a StateMachine instance and compiles it to produce an output that can be understood by the execution environment for which the state machine was designed. The actual compilation steps and the form of the output are dependent on the specifics of the StateMachine class and the target execution platform.
    
    Args:
        cls (type):
             The StateMachineCompiler class itself, indicating that compile is a class method.
        state_machine (StateMachine):
             The state machine instance to be compiled.
