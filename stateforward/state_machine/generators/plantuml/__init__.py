Module __init__.

This module initializes a Python package by defining what should be accessible when the
package is imported. It can be used to set up any package-level configurations, declare global
variables, or import necessary classes and functions from other modules within the same package.
The __init__.py file, stored within a directory, tells Python interpreter that the directory
should be treated as a Python package, allowing the contents to be imported in other Python
files and modules.

Typically, __init__.py files are kept minimal, but they may include complex initializations,
definition of __all__ for explicit exports, and import management to streamline namespace
accessibility. They serve as the entry point to the package's API and its internal components,
structuring how the package elements are exposed to the outside code.
