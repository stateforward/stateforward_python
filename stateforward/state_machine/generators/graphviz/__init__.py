Functions:
    The __init__.py file may include functions that are meant to be used internally within the package to help with initialization.

Classes:
    If the package is designed with classes that need to be instantiated at the time of initialization, they may be defined or imported here.

Exceptions:
    Any exceptions that are specific to the package initialization process could be declared within this module.
