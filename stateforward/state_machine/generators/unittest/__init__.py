Module __init__

This module is the initializer for the package. It sets up the necessary components,
imports, and configurations for the package to function properly. The __init__.py file in
a Python package serves as the entry point for the package, similar to the main() function in
other programming languages. When the package is imported into a Python script, the code in
the __init__.py module is executed. This can include setting up paths, initializing package-level
variables and objects, as well as importing necessary sub-modules and classes to be available at
the package level.

This module is typically used to handle package initialization tasks such as:
- Defining the package's public API by specifying which classes, functions, and variables are
  available when the package is imported.
- Running initialization code that is necessary for the package components to function correctly.
- Setting up a package-wide logging mechanism.
- Checking for the necessary package dependencies and versions.

Attributes:
    Not applicable for initialization modules.

No classes or functions are usually exposed directly by this module as it is intended to serve as
an organizational and setup script rather than a provider of callable members.
