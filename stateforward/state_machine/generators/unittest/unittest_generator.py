"""

Module that provides a `UnitTestGenerator` class, responsible for generating unit tests for state machines.

This module leverages the `stateforward as sf` library to load and traverse state machine models. It contains the `UnitTestGenerator` class which inherits from `sf.model.Visitor`. The class is designed to generate unit tests by visiting the different states and transitions of a `sf.StateMachine` model. The `generate` method of the `UnitTestGenerator` should be implemented to perform the test case generation.

The module also imports `AsyncMock` from `unittest.mock` to facilitate the creation of mock objects for asynchronous code during test generation.

Classes:
    UnitTestGenerator: A visitor class for generating unit tests for state machine models defined by the `stateforward` library.

Functions:
    The module does not provide standalone functions; all functionality is encapsulated within the `UnitTestGenerator` class.

class UnitTestGenerator(sf.model.Visitor):
    """
    A class dedicated to generating unit tests based on state machine models.
        Inherits from the `sf.model.Visitor` class. The primary purpose of this class is to
        traverse the provided state machine model and generate corresponding unit tests
        for each state and transition within the model.
        Attributes:
            None explicitly declared within the class.
        Methods:
            generate(model: sf.StateMachine):
                Generates unit tests for a given state machine.
                This method serves as the interface for converting a state machine model into
                a set of unit tests. It is expected to be implemented to handle the specific
                logic and rules relevant to the model being passed.
                Args:
                    model (sf.StateMachine): The state machine model from which to generate
                        unit tests.
                Returns:
                    None: The method is expected to either write the generated tests to a file
                        or another output stream, rather than return them.
                Raises:
                    NotImplementedError: If this method is not implemented by the subclass.

    def generate(self, model: sf.StateMachine):

            Generates something based on a given state machine model.
            This method utilizes the input state machine model to perform a generation
            task. The exact nature of what it generates is not specified in the description.
            Presumably, it could be code, configuration, or some form of analysis that
            pertains to the state machine's use case.
            Args:
                model (sf.StateMachine): An instance of StateMachine class that presumably
                    contains the necessary data and states required for the generation process.
            Returns:
                The docstring does not specify the return type or value. It is expected that
                the method returns the result of the generation process it performs.
            Raises:
                The docstring does not specify any exceptions that might be raised during the
                generation process. However, appropriate exceptions should be raised in cases
                of invalid input or failure during generation.
